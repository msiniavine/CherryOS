CherryOS 

What is CherryOS?
--------------------
CherryOS is a very simple operating system written to gain 
better understanding of how modern full featured operating systems work.

CherryOS is distributed under General Public License v3. Full license text can
be found at: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt.


On what hardware does it run?
--------------------
CherryOS runs on a VMware virtual machine that supports IA-32 architecture.
There is a chance that it might run on a real 32-bit machine.


How to compile it?
--------------------
Just type:
     make

CherryOS does not have any configuration options, right now.
You will need a version of the gcc compiler, linker and assembler that can generate
an ELF executable for x86 architecture. Standard gcc and binutils that come with
most 32-bit Linux distributions should work. When changing the make file to tweak compiler
options take care not to pull any dependencies from development environment.


How do I run it?
--------------------
After compiling copy the resulting "cherryos" executable into your /boot directory and
add a GRUB2 menu entry for it:
    menuentry 'CherryOS' {
    	      insmod ext2
    	      set root='(hd0,1)'
    	      multiboot /boot/cherryos
    }

Then reboot your system and pick the CherryOS entry in the GRUB menu.

CherryOS uses multiboot specification so relies on a bootloader like GRUB, to
setup the environment and load the kernel into RAM. Anyother multiboot supporting 
bootloader should work just fine. It is recommended to use a virtual
machine to run CherryOS just in case there are some bugs that might damage real hardware.
